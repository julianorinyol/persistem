Work Log:

Aug 17th: Regrouping myself
-I worked on Persistem for one hour,  reaquainting myself, with what's going on. 

Next steps
-I need to be working in a separte view with the evernotes.  
-I would create a separate view/ routes  for evernote notes, so that you can merge all the branches, and work on all the functionality without haveing to checkout branchs.. 
-have the evernotes   be displayed in the same boxes the normal ones are now..
-figure out how to parse the ENML, and display it,  and to update a note and submit it...
-Create a syntax for questions where they are  embedded at the bottom of every note, so that you can create them in evernote....??? not sure..... 
-by the end of next session. Display and edit an evernote..
