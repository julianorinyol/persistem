Persistem is a learning efficiency app, that allows users to turn their evernote notes into questions and quizzes, to improve their memory of the knowledge they learn.


It is in development. Currently users can authenticate syncronize their evernote notes and notesbooks, write questions pertaining to these notes, and then answer these questions or generate quizzes to practice their knowledge.

Currently working on: Writing a test suite, unit tests on models and controllers with Rspec/capynara, and then a separate suite of integration tests written with Cucumber, Selenium and Capybara 

Coming soon:
- After answering a question, user's should be able to grade their answer. The data from this would be used to prioritize the questions where you score the worst.
-Periodic repetition. The app will test you on questions you create at intervals. One week, a month, 3 months, 6 months, one year. These intervals will also be affected by how you score yourself when answering questions.
